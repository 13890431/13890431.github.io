Reflection 2: Professional Practice within Intercultural and Global Contexts
At my Optik Internship I worked with a team of 5 other engineers; we all came from different
backgrounds, upbringings, family dynamics, many of us from different countries. Initially it seems so
hard to connect with people so different from yourself. We got to our desks on the first day and barely
anyone said a word.
But it wasn’t long until we warmed up to each other. The concept of being “forced” to be around these
people quickly turned from torture to treasured memories and something that has enabled this
transition and for the team to get to know one another were rather than our similarities our differences.
This wasn’t without struggle though and sometimes conversations about cultural differences became
unprofessional and made people uncomfortable. As a team lead this was really disappointing. I
wanted to maintain the use of cultural experience as a mechanism to bond and not to drive apart.
This means maintaining more consideration of how any given conversation topic could make people
feel uncomfortable or excluded and to avoid this and limit discourse over things controversial.
"Further one should accept the fact it is not the matter of culture, in fact it is the matter of quality.
Therefore, for improving productivity, quality has to be maintained and not thrown out" was a key
conclusion in Ankita Saxena (2014), and whilst I agree that differences in culture are not relevant in
the world of productivity, I think they can also serve to broaden one's perspective and not only learn
about experiences different to their own but learn how to engage better in intercultural and global
contexts both professionally, and sometimes unprofessionally.
