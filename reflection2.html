                <p><strong>Professional Practice within Intercultural and Global Contexts</strong></p>
                <p>At my Optik Internship I worked with a team of 5 other engineers; we all came from different backgrounds, upbringings, family dynamics, many of us from different countries. Initially it seems so hard to connect with people so different from yourself. We got to our desks on the first day and barely anyone said a word.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Context & Background</h2>
                <p>But it wasn't long until we warmed up to each other. The concept of being "forced" to be around these people quickly turned from torture to treasured memories and something that has enabled this transition and for the team to get to know one another were rather than our similarities our differences.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Analysis & Learning</h2>
                <p>This wasn't without struggle though and sometimes conversations about cultural differences became unprofessional and made people uncomfortable. As a team lead this was really disappointing. I wanted to maintain the use of cultural experience as a mechanism to bond and not to drive apart.</p>
                <p>This means maintaining more consideration of how any given conversation topic could make people feel uncomfortable or excluded and to avoid this and limit discourse over things controversial.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Professional Impact</h2>
                <p>"Further one should accept the fact it is not the matter of culture, in fact it is the matter of quality. Therefore, for improving productivity, quality has to be maintained and not thrown out" was a key conclusion in Ankita Saxena (2014), and whilst I agree that differences in culture are not relevant in the world of productivity, I think they can also serve to broaden one's perspective and not only learn about experiences different to their own but learn how to engage better in intercultural and global contexts both professionally, and sometimes unprofessionally.</p>
