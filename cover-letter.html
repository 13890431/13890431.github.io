                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>My name is Lachlan Sinclair and I am a Software Engineering Student graduating from the University of Technology Sydney in November 2025. I was drawn to this opportunity by your company's innovative engineering projects and commitment to furthering positive social and environmental causes which aligns well with my passion for using engineering as a tool for positive impact.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p><strong>Commitment to ethical conduct and the highest standards of professional accountability:</strong> During my Internship at Optik Consultancy I led a project with a team of six engineers from varying disciplines. Over time it became apparent that one of the members in my team was struggling with technical aspects of the project. Despite the fact we were still on track to finish the project and were successful it was important to address the situation out of professional accountability as the leader of the team. Rather than ignoring the issue I proactively sought to understand his strengths and passions such as his experience in business. I then pivoted his responsibilities to leverage these strengths including helping to develop pitches and analysing our app from a usability and business value perspective. This strategy allowed for a member who was previously uninterested in the project to be able to contribute in a meaningful way and productive way, while my actions demonstrated a strong professional accountability for the productivity and satisfaction of my entire team.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p><strong>Demonstrated ability to effectively communicate both with other engineers and with stakeholders from different fields:</strong> While serving as a software consultant during and following my internship with our client Dryflow Magnetics, it was at first difficult to manage the technical knowledge gap when discussing a complex software project with stakeholders with limited experience. My task was to find a way to effectively bridge this communication gap with my team of Software and Data Engineers with the non-technical client to ensure a product that satisfies their requirements and expectations whilst managing the limitations and challenges presented technically. I managed this during discourse through email and meetings with our clients by explaining the complex technical processes of our project in a simpler and digestible format highlighting the most important details for them such as progress, challenges and success criteria. Additionally I listened actively to the client's business needs and translated their feedback and requests into actionable items for the team. This clear communication resulted in a successful project that was both fulfilling for my team and myself whilst also meeting the needs of the client.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p><strong>The ability to engage with a creative, innovative and proactive environment:</strong> While serving as a programming teacher for young students in schools across New South Wales it was important to make sure that class was appealing to the young students. I would spend my personal time leading up to lessons planning engaging ways to frame the course work in contexts that would resonate with the demographic. This included teaching concepts in an interactive environment with verbal participation and questions for the students, providing fun challenges that would encourage them to take the concepts from today's lesson and challenge their creative and logical thinking skills. This resulted in the lessons being enjoyable for the students and maintaining a full attendance rate throughout the program despite being extra-curricular whilst also helping young students learn about engineering and programming.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p><strong>Demonstrated ability to use and manage information:</strong> For my Engineering Capstone project I completed a Software and Data project to assess machine learning and AI tools ability in the identification and management of cybersecurity threats for electrical grid systems. I was required to manage and evaluate the role of thousands of features across tens of thousands of rows of data. I utilised common data science python libraries such as pandas and numpy to systematically clean and filter the dataset handling the thousands of simulation events and anomalous data points. I then used a large selection of machine learning algorithms and AI tools to create categorization models for the electrical grids status. My methodical approach to this project demonstrated an ability to use and manage large sets of information and my results concluding the viability of machine learning tools in successfully predicting the grid status demonstrated my success in this.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p><strong>The ability to manage your own performance in a professional environment:</strong> Following my internship at Optik I continued as a software consultant for my client company Dryflow Magnetics. Previously I was working in a more controlled environment with a team to help hold me accountable as well as leadership but since the conclusion of the internship I have been responsible for working alone on the project. To maintain accountability and effective management of my work and progress on the project I adopted a very detailed reporting system where I would at the start of each week outline my intent and targets for that week with detailed success criteria and risk assessments. And then at the end of the week a summary report detailing how my progress has measured against my estimations and indepth breakdown of how my time had been spent and reports on feedback and meetings with the client. These tools helped me to manage and assess my own performance within a professional environment despite having more limited interaction and oversight from others.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p><strong>A demonstrated ability to work as part of a team and to show leadership when required:</strong> At the beginning of my internship the project groups were prompted to volunteer a leader for the project. Initially nobody volunteered for this, but as it was required and I wished to be able to get the most from this experience I stepped up into the position. At first this was quite challenging because I had no prior experience in a leading role and wasn't sure on how to effectively manage and motivate a team so different to myself. But overtime through both my own research, time spent bonding with and understanding my team and leadership workshops organised through the internship I was afforded the opportunity to develop and improve my leadership skills. A key moment was realising the importance of reviewing the productivity of the team regularly, identifying what doesn't work and making changes to the processes and operation of the team to improve our output and satisfaction. Making these changes and working constantly to create systems that were personalized and worked the best for our team allowed us to all have a very positive experience during the internship and served as a good demonstration of my ability to work in a team and display leadership when required.</p>

                    <p>I look forward to further discussing my qualifications and enthusiasm for this position in an interview and have attached my resume.</p>
