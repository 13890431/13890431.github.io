                <h2>Reflection Topic</h2>
                <p><strong>Principles of Sustainability to Create Viable Systems</strong></p>
                <p>A sustainable system is one which is not only functional but demonstrates resilience, efficacy and long term viability. In a field as evolving as software where new technological overhauls always feel imminent it cannot be more important to constantly consider and judge our systems and how they reflect these criteria.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Context & Background</h2>
                <p>In my internship with Optik as part of my wider project I was tasked with automating the processing and uploading of client data into a format that would enable easier access and visualization. I would constantly find issues; this file had too many 0s in its id field, this size is in the wrong measurement and now messes up my calculations amongst so many more it could fill a novel. Instead of ignoring these errors I would fix them, after all how is my system going to demonstrate any value if it breaks from a single misplaced keystroke.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Analysis & Learning</h2>
                <p>Initially this was going in and identifying the individual faults and putting a bandaid on them. Eventually though a sort of epiphany came over me to which would seem common sense to others that instead of trying to cover the blemishes in my code I should try to develop my systems in a fashion that is more encompassing of these edge cases and can finally stand the scrutiny of millimeter measurements.</p>
                <p>And, so I went back and wrote it from scratch. I understood the requirements of the system better and afforded to be conscious of all edge cases and reasonable risks during the design of the system itself. Suddenly, instead of needing 40 different cases to block a file upload for a user I can identify and resolve these issues during the processing of the file itself, boosting the efficiency of the user's experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Professional Impact</h2>
                <p>The system began seeing use much earlier than we anticipated and I was extremely nervous, sure it worked when I used it but what if it doesn't when they do, what if I didn't catch everything. And maybe it doesn't catch everything (it is truly hard to say) but it's been a month and I have yet to receive a panicked email which maybe isn't long term viability sure but it's something.</p>
                <p>This experience helped me to realise the value of the consideration of sustainability within the development of systems to create better software that is functional for real world use.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-section">
                <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
                <p><strong>Resilience:</strong> Often overlooked in a world of minimum viable products, vibe coded prototypes and data breaches. It is the fundamental way our systems can stand-up to scrutiny and bounce back from issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong> More than just time-complexity or power usage; it is the ability for a system to achieve its goals without hindrance.</p>
                <p><strong>Viability:</strong> The readiness of a system for use today and in the future.</p>

                <h2>Academic Reference</h2>
                <p>Sriraman, G., & Raghunathan, S concluded in their exploration of sustainable software development the necessity to "assess current practices, set goals, identify opportunities, develop an action plan, monitor, and measure progress, and iterate and improve." and it is easy to draw parallels with my personal experience with the flaws in my "current practice" of individually fixing every error with my flawed system to instead "identify the opportunity" to create a more robust and whole fuel system where I acted and iterated to make a more sustainable system.</p>
